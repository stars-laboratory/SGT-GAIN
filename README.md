# SGT-GAIN

Transformer-enabled GAIN with selective generation (SGT-GAIN) is proposed to address the critical missing region issue. In the proposed SGT-GAIN, a transformer-enabled generator is demonstrated to capture the sequential relationship among the window-based samples. Besides, the selective generation framework is proposed to reduce the imputation bias and learn the data patterns comprehensively. Furthermore, the ensemble learning framework is incorporated with SGT-GAIN to improve the model robustness and reduce the imputation variation.
